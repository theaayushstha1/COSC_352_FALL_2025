The objective of project 6 was to port project 5 to golang.
Golang is a programming language developed by google in 2009. Golang it is charectarized as a cross between python and C. 
I think that this is a fair assesment.
Similar to C, "Go" does not have built support for OOP, classes must be coded up using structs. 
And Similar to python there isnt any strict line and block ending syntax. 
These two features, (or feature and lack of) make Go a safe solid language that is also consise.
In regards to the Scala implementation the differences were stark. The Scala inpmplementation was considerably longer along with its docker image. This is due to the fact that Scala runs on the JVM, and Go compiles straight to binary.

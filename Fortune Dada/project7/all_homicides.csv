Blogger note: We don't know when the Medical Examiner decided this was a homicide. We are being apprised of this 03/28/23. More month stacking by the BPD is my guess. I have no clue about this victim's birth date because we don't know if he was 44 when he was shot, or when he died, or he would have been 44 on 03/28/23.

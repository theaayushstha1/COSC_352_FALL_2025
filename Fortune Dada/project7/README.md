This project is a Shiny dashboard that visualizes Baltimore City homicide data from 2021 through 2025.
All data comes from chamspage.blogspot.com, which publishes yearly homicide lists. 
I built a scraper to collect the data, cleaned it, and combined it into one dataset. The dashboard lets users filter, search, and explore the information interactively.

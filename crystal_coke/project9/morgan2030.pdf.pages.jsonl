{"page": 4, "text": "The Morgan State University \nLeadership Imperative: A Message from the President\nAt its core, this planning effort reflects our need to prepare the University for strategic growth and continued \nascendency over the next ten years. Moreover, it reflects our concerted and continuous pursuit of excellence \nand a renewed commitment to fulfilling the University’s vital mission. Animated by that spirit, this plan (in \nlarge measure) focuses on human resource priorities, institutional capacity-building and the development \nof an organizational infrastructure that can best foster sustainable growth over the next ten years, and \nbeyond. Embedded in this goal is our determination to realize greater operational excellence in our various \norganizational systems and processes and address needed improvements in our overall service delivery.\nA FOCUS ON LEADERSHIP\nThis planning effort began in January 2020 with a \nthoughtful examination of our distinctive mission \nand a reaffirmation of the core values that have served \nthis venerable institution well for so many years. \nThose enduring values remain an integral part of our \ninstitutional inheritance. Foremost among those \nbedrock values is the concept of leadership, in all of its \nforms and expressions. Since its inception in 1867, this \ninstitution has focused on the quintessential goal to \nprepare its students to assume dynamic leadership \nroles in their chosen professions and communities. \nLike any viable institution, Morgan State University \ncontinues to measure its success by the success of its \nstudents and alumni. And that is as it should be. Thus, \na significant aspect of this plan focuses on creating \na dynamic living-learning environment where \nstudent achievement is optimized and celebrated \nand where leadership development is a purposeful \ninstitutional goal. \nAt Morgan, it is commonly understood that our \nemerging leaders will be mission-oriented and will \nultimately aspire to be a force for good in the world. \nIn brief, there has always been an explicit expectation \nthat Morgan students and alumni would continue \nto heed the call to servant leadership, thereby \ndedicating themselves to the broader struggle of \novercoming and eradicating barriers to social justice, \neconomic empowerment and engaged citizenship. \nThat leadership imperative is further expressed \nin our renewed strategic intention to deepen \nand expand our role as an anchor institution in \nBaltimore City and beyond.\nI take this opportunity to thank all who participated in and contributed to the formulation of this strategic plan. \nOur Transformation Morgan 2030: Leading the Future plan constitutes an amalgamation of vital inputs from \nvarious individual shareholders and constituent groups who have given generously of their time and expertise to \nproduce this blueprint for the strategic advancement of Morgan State University, 2021-2030.

In this regard, our plan boldly puts forth the \ngoal of elevating Morgan State University as a leading \nand nationally-recognized research institution that \nhas justifiably secured Carnegie classification as \nan “R1 institution.” Suffice it to say here, that the \nbenefits of such an important designation are indeed \nsweeping and incalculable.\nEXPANDING OUR GLOBAL FOOTPRINT\nFinally, this plan reflects and affirms a distinctive \nstrategic thrust to internationalize our curriculum \nand expand the University’s global footprint. In an \nage of rapid globalization, we seek to extend our reach \ninto countries in critical need of educational services \nand interventions. This will require forging enduring \ncross-national partnerships, enhancing international \nstudent and faculty diversity on campus and \ndeveloping effective models and educational delivery \nsystems targeting underserved populations. We view \nsuch initiatives as a logical and necessary extension of \nthe Morgan Global leadership imperative finding fuller \nexpression on a much wider international stage.\nGROWING OUR RESOURCES\nIn summary, the execution of this plan will require \nour best energies and an unwavering determination \nto give full expression to our longstanding leadership \nimperative. Yet as a practical matter, the fulfillment \nof this plan is largely resource-contingent. That said, \nwe must embrace a well-coordinated and shared \napproach to institutional advancement aimed at \nsignificantly expanding our human and monetary \nresource base and reinforcing our financial solvency \nin the years ahead. This can be best achieved by \nimproving our private sector fundraising efforts and \nsecuring additional research and training grants that \nmeet pressing human development and workforce \nneeds. Ideally, this will entail the acquisition of more \nimpactful and transformational gifts that enhance \nour capacities and meaningfully convey our overall \ninvestment-worthiness to the broader corporate and \nphilanthropic community.\nThrough this multidimensional plan, we intensify \nour culture of continuous improvement and set out \non a journey beginning with a candid assessment \nof our institutional strengths, recognizing the \ntremendous challenges and opportunities that lay \nahead. In retrospect, we have advanced as a venerable, \nservice-oriented institution rooted in and rigorously \nreaffirming its core values. Today, we constitute a \ndynamic living-learning community that embraces \nthe same sentiment and pursuit of excellence invoked \nby our campus designation as “a national treasure.” \nIn outlook, we are clearly a dynamic institution \npoised for greatness and strategic growth on an \nunprecedented scale. This is work that is undeniably \nworthy of our time, talent and treasure. This is the \nnecessary and ennobling work that will enable us \nto harness our collective strengths and solidify \nour future. This is visionary and constructive work \nthat will ensure our institutional viability well into \nthe 21st century. \nA NEW DECADE OF STRATEGIC GROWTH\nToday, we stand poised to usher in a new decade of \nstrategic growth; one that will build upon Morgan \nState University’s well-earned reputation as an \ninstitutional leader and a dynamic training ground for \nthe education of responsible and responsive leaders, \nparticularly at a time such as this. Through this plan, \nour time-honored mission will be fulfilled as we \nchart an intentional pathway to meet contemporary \nand foreseeable challenges and opportunities and \neffectively position Morgan State University in the \nforefront of the higher educational enterprise. This is \na vision that is truly worthy of renewed dedication and \nour best efforts.

{"page": 13, "text": "N\nNow more than ever, institutions of higher learning have had to rethink their business models and conduct \nstrategic planning, particularly in an indefinite and increasingly competitive educational marketplace. Most \nrecently, the ongoing COVID pandemic has tested the adaptability and agility of colleges and universities, \nforcing them to effectively pivot and quickly adopt new methods of educational service delivery that are safe, \neffective and cost efficient.  In addition, shifting demographic trends and economic considerations are fueling \na preference for asynchronous learning and a heightened demand for more flexible and affordable on-line \neducational options.\nIn a broader perspective, racial and social injustices, health disparities, and economic inequalities are bringing \ninto sharper focus the roles progressive colleges and universities might play in formulating and implementing \ninterdisciplinary and innovative solutions to these problems. The escalating scale and complexity of these \nproblems will require thoughtful collaboration with other responsive organizations and agencies. Operating \nin this context, Morgan State University is obliged to reexamine its strategic directions and forge new strategic \npartnerships, predicated on its research aspirations and the fulfillment of its distinctive urban mission.\t\nAt the center of our planning efforts is a transformational vision to grow and position Morgan State University as \na dynamic epicenter for the convergence of scholarship, research and advocacy. Thus, we are determined to play \na preeminent role in the cross-fertilization, integration and application of ideas, practices and pedagogies that \npromote scientific and technological innovation, entrepreneurial prowess and dynamic leadership for a global \ncommunity in pursuit of economic  justice and sustainable peace and prosperity. \nLEANING FORWARD: THE STRATEGIC PLANNING IMPERATIVE\nOUR STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESSES\nWith the endorsement and support of the University’s \nBoard of Regents, President David K. Wilson was \ntasked with engaging the campus community and \nthe University’s various constituency groups in the \ndevelopment of a ten-year strategic plan covering the \nperiod, 2021-2030. Such a plan was viewed as a logical \nextension of the University’s previous strategic plan \nentitled, Growing the Future, Leading the World: \nThe Strategic Plan for Morgan State University, 2011-\n2021. As envisioned, the resultant strategic plan \nwould help to strategically position and advance the \nUniversity along carefully chosen lines of established \nexcellence and opportunity.\nBuilding on the success of the previous planning effort \nand the subsequent growth of the University over the \npast ten years, a new and equally inclusive strategic \nplan was imagined. As in the previous undertaking, \nthis new plan similarly takes into consideration \nthe University’s strengths and underscores the \nimportance of synergistic engagements with \norganizations and agencies based on a solid mutuality \nof purpose. Likewise, this updated plan surveys the \nhigher educational landscape to determine current \nand foreseeable demographic and workforce trends \nand critical needs throughout  the Greater Baltimore \nregion, the nation at large and the global community.\nFrom the outset, our Transformation Morgan \n2030 plan involved a decidedly transparent and \nconsultative process. Accordingly, President Wilson \nlaunched this planning initiative in January 2020 by \nappointing a Strategic Planning Steering Committee \nto be chaired by Dr. Don-Terry Veal, the University’s \nChief of Staff.  The Committee was comprised of \nfaculty, students, staff, alumni, administrators, deans \nand representatives from the local community. \nThis committee adopted guiding principles that \nwere closely followed. Those principles were \nintentionally consistent with the University’s mission, \nvision and core values. \nThe committee then developed and executed a \nstructured and methodical planning process. \nProject tasks, milestones, and deliverables were \nidentified and approved. This entailed conducting \ninternal environmental scans to determine the \ncurrent state of affairs in key units and departments \nand collecting and interpreting data from various \ninternal sources including, but not limited to: The \nLEADING THE FUTURE 13\nMORGAN.EDU\n"}

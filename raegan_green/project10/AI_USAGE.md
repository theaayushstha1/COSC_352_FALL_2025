## Educational Value

Using AI allowed:
- Focus on understanding TM theory vs implementation details
- Rapid prototyping of multiple machines
- More time for testing and verification
- Better documentation than manual writing

AI served as a knowledgeable assistant that provided theoretical CS knowledge and coding expertise while human maintained control over design decisions and quality assurance.

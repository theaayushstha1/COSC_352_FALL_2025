Implementation Details
Algorithm Overview
The search engine implements TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) ranking with the following components:
1. Text Extraction
•	It extracts text from PDF files using PyPDF2
•	Splits text into passages (paragraphs separated by double newlines)
•	Filters passages to minimum 50 characters
•	Tracks page numbers for each passage
2. Tokenization
•	Converts text to lowercase
•	Extracts words with 3+ characters using regex pattern \b\w{3,}\b
•	Removes punctuation and special characters
3. TF (Term Frequency) Calculation
TF = 1 + log(term_count)  if term appears in passage
TF = 0                     otherwise
•	Uses logarithmic scaling to diminish returns for very frequent terms
•	Prevents longer documents from dominating just by word count
4. IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) Calculation
IDF = log(total_passages / passages_containing_term)
•	Gives higher weight to rare terms
•	Common words (appearing in many passages) get lower scores
•	Ensures term rarity contributes to relevance
5. Length Normalization
Final Score = (TF * IDF) / sqrt(passage_length)
•	Divides by square root of passage length (in tokens)
•	Prevents longer passages from having unfair advantage
•	Ensures relevance per unit of text
6. Ranking
•	Passages sorted by score in descending order
•	Top N results returned
•	Results with score ≤ 0.0 are filtered out
Key Features
TF-IDF Scoring - Sophisticated relevance ranking
Term Frequency - Logarithmically scaled term counts
Term Rarity - Inverse document frequency weighting
Length Normalization - Fair comparison across passage sizes
Multi-word Queries - Handles queries with multiple keywords
Page Tracking - Shows which page each result is from
Text Snippets - Displays first 250 characters of each result

Testing
Test Case 1: "research innovation"
•	Query: Multi-word query about research and innovation
•	Expected: Passages mentioning research activities
•	Result:  Returns 3 relevant passages from pages 26, 6, and 5
Test Case 2: "gradient descent optimization"
•	Query: Technical terms from ML/optimization
•	Expected: Returns passages about optimization techniques
•	Result: Returns relevant technical passages
Design Decisions
Why Python Integration?
•	Mojo 0.25.7 has compatibility issues with complex struct types
•	Python provides robust PDF processing (PyPDF2)
•	Python's regex and math libraries are well-tested
•	Allows focus on algorithm implementation rather than type system issues
Why This TF-IDF Formula?
•	Logarithmic TF: Prevents term frequency from dominating scores
•	IDF weighting: Ensures rare, specific terms matter more
•	Length normalization: √length provides balanced normalization (not too aggressive)
